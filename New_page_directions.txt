To add a new page you put the .html file in the views directory.
You also need to write a page handler, to be placed somewhere in
the controllers directory (more on this later).

Then you open main.py and add your new url to the urls dictionary.

For example:
urls = [
    ('/', utils.MainHandler),
    ('/page_one', utils.OneHandler),
    ('/page_two', utils.TwoHandler)]

becomes

urls = [
    ('/', utils.MainHandler),
    ('/page_one', utils.OneHandler),
    ('/page_two', utils.TwoHandler),
    ('/page_three', utils.ThreeHandler)]

if you want to add a new page called page_three that uses a handler
in the file utils.py called ThreeHandler.

A handler is a class that requires at least one function (the get function).
They look like this...

class MyHandler(BaseHandler):
      def get(self):
      	  #rest of the code...

This example extends BaseHandler. It looks like most, if not all, of our new handlers
should also extend BaseHandler. I added a really simple handler called MostBasicHandler
to utils.py at line 226 and a simple html page as well called new_page.html
To do more complex things with the handlers, looking at existing handlers would 
be a good start.
